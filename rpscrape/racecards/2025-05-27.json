I am looking for a nice run from him this week, but it could be that we have him wrong and he is a sprinter. 29-06-23"}],"number":9,"draw":5,"headgear":"b","headgear_first":"1","lbs":124,"ofr":65,"rpr":90,"ts":73,"jockey":"Sean Levey","jockey_id":84636,"last_run":"11","form":"242565","trainer_rtf":"33","stats":{"course":{"runs":"3","wins":"1"},"distance":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"14","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"38","last_14_wins":"7","last_14_wins_pct":"18%","last_14_profit":"-8.75","ovr_runs":"175","ovr_wins":"26","ovr_wins_pct":"15%","ovr_profit":"-40.98"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"12","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-12.00","ovr_runs":"177","ovr_wins":"14","ovr_wins_pct":"8%","ovr_profit":"-85.72"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":4175520,"name":"Molly Valentine","dob":"2020-02-14","sex":"mare","sex_code":"M","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"T J Rooney","dam":"Molly Dolly","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Tamayuz","sire_region":"GB","grandsire":"Nayef","damsire":"Exceed And Excel","damsire_region":"AUS","trainer":"Dean Ivory","trainer_id":15107,"trainer_location":"Radlett, Herts","trainer_14_days":{"runs":6,"wins":0,"percent":0},"owner":"Heather & Michael Yarrow","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"C&D winner; 6lb higher than for latest win and drawn wide, but still holds each-way claims","spotlight":"Patchy form of late, but she did manage to win over C&D in December and in first-time blinkers at Lingfield (1m2f, Polytrack) last month (a couple of subsequent winners behind); 6lb higher and drawn wider than ideal, but still holds each-way claims if near her best.","medical":[{"date":"2022-07-06","type":"Wind Surgery"}],"quotes":null,"stable_tour":null,"number":10,"draw":11,"headgear":"b","headgear_first":"","lbs":123,"ofr":64,"rpr":83,"ts":67,"jockey":"William Carson","jockey_id":84882,"last_run":"47","form":"51-981","trainer_rtf":"17","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"distance":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"going":{"runs":"11","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"15","last_14_wins":"2","last_14_wins_pct":"13%","last_14_profit":"-4.00","ovr_runs":"263","ovr_wins":"16","ovr_wins_pct":"6%","ovr_profit":"-152.11"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"6","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-6.00","ovr_runs":"48","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"10%","ovr_profit":"-14.25"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":5017666,"name":"Golspie","dob":"2020-03-20","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"IRE","breeder":"Ballinacurra Stud Ltd","dam":"Surrey Storm","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Ribchester","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Iffraaj","damsire":"Montjeu","damsire_region":"IRE","trainer":"Patrick Morris","trainer_id":14293,"trainer_location":"Prescott, Merseyside","trainer_14_days":{"runs":7,"wins":2,"percent":29},"owner":"Patrick Morris","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Eve Johnson Houghton","trainer_id":18920,"change_date":"2024-05-04"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Mick and Janice Mariscotti","owner_id":160338,"change_date":"2024-05-04"}],"comment":"Placed in last three starts off this mark including twice runner-up over C&D; thereabouts","spotlight":"0-17 since his successful debut, but placed in his last three starts off this mark including when twice runner-up over C&D in March; thereabouts; stable triple-handed.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Golspie","horse_id":5017666,"quote":"This colt made a winning start to his career when taking a mile maiden at Newbury, when I thought he had a good chance.
