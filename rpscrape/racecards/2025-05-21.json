He's not very big but his stable name at home is ‘Naughty' because affectionately he's like that by nature. However, he just keeps battling and trying in his races. He was fifth at Taunton over 2m last week and our doubt was that the ground was slightly on the softer side and that he had 12st, which wasn't ideal for a small horse. He's a nice horse for novice handicap chases and there's lots to like about him. 16-01-25"}],"number":7,"draw":0,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":150,"ofr":106,"rpr":121,"ts":111,"jockey":"Charlie Deutsch","jockey_id":92270,"last_run":"27","form":"14536-","trainer_rtf":"55","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"12","wins":"2"},"going":{"runs":"4","wins":"1"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"9","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-9.00","ovr_runs":"52","ovr_wins":"4","ovr_wins_pct":"8%","ovr_profit":"-42.87"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"11","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-11.00","ovr_runs":"31","ovr_wins":"1","ovr_wins_pct":"3%","ovr_profit":"-28.25"}}},{"age":7,"horse_id":3197365,"name":"Tara Iti","dob":"2018-04-13","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"ch","region":"GB","breeder":"Mr & Mrs C Bonner","dam":"Royal Warranty","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Sixties Icon","sire_region":"GB","grandsire":"Galileo","damsire":"Sir Percy","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"James Owen","trainer_id":40072,"trainer_location":"Newmarket, Suffolk","trainer_14_days":{"runs":46,"wins":12,"percent":26},"owner":"Deva Racing Cc","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Gary & Josh Moore","trainer_id":41396,"change_date":"2025-02-24"},{"trainer":"Gary Moore","trainer_id":7833,"change_date":"2024-05-02"},{"trainer":"Ed Dunlop","trainer_id":9036,"change_date":"2021-06-26"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Mark Albon And Gary Moore","owner_id":266352,"change_date":"2025-02-24"},{"owner":"Mrs Susan Roy","owner_id":86531,"change_date":"2021-06-26"}],"comment":"Dual hurdle winner for new stable this spring; may yet have a bigger run in him","spotlight":"Revitalised by new stable this spring, winning two low-grade hurdles on good ground; took fairly heavy fall at Huntingdon last month and was slightly disappointing on the Flat 12 days ago but may yet have a bigger run in him.","quotes":[{"date":"2020-10-13","horse":"Tara Iti","horse_id":3197365,"race":"Veolia Nursery Handicap (Div II)","race_id":769076,"course":"Leicester","course_id":30,"distance_f":8,"distance_y":1813,"quote":"Tara Iti is bred to go on this testing ground.
