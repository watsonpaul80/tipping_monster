The big handicaps suit him because he needs a proper gallop in a race and needs to be off the bridle.

This year, though, they've been tough races. We had him entered in the Stewards' Cup but the problem was that when the weights came out he was on a mark of 110. However, by the time of the race he had dropped to 107 and we felt there was no point running him off a mark 3lb higher than his actual rating, so that's why we missed the race.  He ran on Saturday at York, finishing a great third behind Elmonjed. I've entered him in the Beverley Bullet on Saturday but I'm not sure whether he'll run yet.
