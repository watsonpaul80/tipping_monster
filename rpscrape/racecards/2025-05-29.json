The Greatwood Hurdle or the Masterton Holdings Hurdle was the plan, but we thought he was very well handicapped and would learn more in the Greatwood. Harry Cobden gave him a fantastic ride, he settled lovely in front and won nicely, and jumped well for his fourth career start in a handicap. He was then third in the Christmas Hurdle behind Constitution Hill and Lossiemouth.

Even the first day he won at Nottingham, I still maintain that if he hadn't got a bump near the finish, he'd have finished second; he got a bump and seemed to take off and won really well. He then went to Beverley and had a bit of a troubled passage but got to the front and was well on top at the finish.
