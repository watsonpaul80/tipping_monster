The Greatwood Hurdle or the Masterton Holdings Hurdle was the plan, but we thought he was very well handicapped and would learn more in the Greatwood. Harry Cobden gave him a fantastic ride, he settled lovely in front and won nicely, and jumped well for his fourth career start in a handicap. He was then third in the Christmas Hurdle behind Constitution Hill and Lossiemouth.

Even the first day he won at Nottingham, I still maintain that if he hadn't got a bump near the finish, he'd have finished second; he got a bump and seemed to take off and won really well. He then went to Beverley and had a bit of a troubled passage but got to the front and was well on top at the finish. When he went to Wetherby for his third success, the ground was plenty quick enough for him and the race didn't go as smoothly as we'd have liked, but he still won, whiwas fair play to him.
