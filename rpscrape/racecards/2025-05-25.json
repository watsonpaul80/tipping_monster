Last year he started off on 103 in July but by the time he had wrapped up the campaign he had won three straight races including the Group 2 Prix Dollar on Arc weekend at Longchamp. He had a very good winter and I was keen to get a Group 1 under his belt, so we targeted the Prix d'Ispahan. He had a very pleasing return when second to Adayar while having to concede 5lb, which was no bad effort. It brought him to just where I wanted and we took the chance of going to France, where you know they can go very slow and then sprint. Thankfully he's very agile and has a great cruising speed and turn of foot. The ground was certainly faster by race time than it was advertised in the morning, but it didn't seem to be a problem, although I wouldn't want to run him on anything quicker. We spoke to Angus [Gold, Shadwell's racing manager] about Royal Ascot and the Prince of Wales's Stakes, but we thought it best to give him an extra couple of weeks after that and look at the Eclipse. Then he would have the obvious targets like the Juddmonte, Irish Champion and ultimately the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October.

He doesn't need deep ground and in Dubai he ran well on a faster surface, but I think in an Arc it would give him a bit of an edge. Andre is such a master of making the right decision. I would think that's the first option, but if we don't run well at Saint-Cloud and coming back in distance doesn't work, we'll give Melbourne a thought.
