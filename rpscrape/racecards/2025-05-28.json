The handicapper has raised him 10lb during that time, but that has helped his cause of getting in the Grand National, for which he has been allotted 10st 2lb, and he is 58th on the list to get in, so it is in the lap of the gods. If he gets balloted out then we have an alternative plan which is the bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown on the final day of the season. He has finished second at Aintree and this season while at Sandown he has filled the same position twice. We know he stays very well so hopefully he will get in the National. 16-03-22"}],"number":1,"draw":0,"headgear":"b","headgear_first":"","lbs":168,"ofr":127,"rpr":134,"ts":107,"jockey":"Adam Wedge","jockey_id":86912,"last_run":"59","form":"P2604-","trainer_rtf":"","stats":{"course":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"8","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"13%","last_14_profit":"-1.50","ovr_runs":"74","ovr_wins":"7","ovr_wins_pct":"9%","ovr_profit":"-46.38"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"1","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-1.00","ovr_runs":"55","ovr_wins":"5","ovr_wins_pct":"9%","ovr_profit":"-27.50"}}},{"age":9,"horse_id":2892896,"name":"Investment Manager","dob":"2016-03-11","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"GB","breeder":"Two Days In Paris Partnership","dam":"Two Days In Paris","dam_region":"FR","sire":"Nathaniel","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Galileo","damsire":"Authorized","damsire_region":"IRE","trainer":"Joe Tizzard","trainer_id":39475,"trainer_location":"Milborne Port, Dorset","trainer_14_days":{"runs":5,"wins":2,"percent":40},"owner":"Brocade Racing","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Colin Tizzard","trainer_id":11016,"change_date":"2022-10-20"}],"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Often leads; has five wins and five seconds to show from 12 previous visits to this track","spotlight":"Often leads; has five wins and five seconds to show from 12 previous visits to this track, including a win in this 12 months ago (on soft); returns off a 3lb lower mark and latest 12l defeat here was on good ground that would have been on the lively side; every chance with rain forecast.","medical":[{"date":"2023-06-09","type":"Wind Surgery"}],"quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Investment Manager","horse_id":2892896,"quote":"He's been in excellent form and we're going to look at regional Nationals for him, maybe at Plumpton or the Devon National at Exeter.

He's peaking now and I'm really pleased with him. He's from the same family as Princess Zoe, so it's a lovely pedigree. He'll go to Haydock on Saturday for the Albert Bartlett trial, a race we won with Chief Dan George, and we'll dip our toe in the water to see where we are. He's got the entry in the main race at Cheltenham and will go there if he comes through his test at Haydock. There's a possibility we might look at the Sefton at Aintree, but it's one step at a time.
