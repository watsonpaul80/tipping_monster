He came forward for that and I expected a big run last week at Doncaster, when he did not disappoint with a 4L win. Potentially he could be anything as our juveniles usually come on a lot for their initial efforts. The plan immediately after that was the Superlative Stakes this week but I spoke to his owner afterwards and he is a very patient man with his horses and suggested we may wait a little longer, in which case the Listed Pat Eddery Stakes at Ascot on 24 July would be the target. This son of Churchill has always looked a cut above my others and the lads that have ridden him at home have all said he feels like a proper horse.
