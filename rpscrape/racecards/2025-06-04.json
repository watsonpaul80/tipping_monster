He'd shown enough at home, plenty to be honest, but he's so laid-back, which was a little concern of mine and that's maybe why he was a longer price than he should have been.

Unfortunately he's been plagued with problems; he's got a suppressed immune response without a shadow of a doubt and has been very difficult to train. As a result he'll never achieve what he possibly could have done. He's incredibly genuine and a lot of horses wouldn't have faced the bridle suffering what he's been through. He's had to have constant treatment and the owners have had to be so patient - for them it's like owning two horses in training as he has to have constant physio.
