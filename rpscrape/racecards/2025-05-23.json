She missed the break and when she came with a run she got stopped. She's rated 77, which I think is quite harsh - I think it's about 4lb heavy really - but she could very nearly have won. She got beaten five lengths and gave away more than that and got stopped in her run, so I think sheâs all right. Weâll look for a restricted maiden again because she gets the GB bonus, which is worth the same as a decent handicap. 06-06-24"}],"number":5,"draw":10,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":134,"ofr":82,"rpr":93,"ts":77,"jockey":"David Egan","jockey_id":95388,"last_run":"26","form":"1331-3","trainer_rtf":"27","stats":{"course":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"5","wins":"1"},"going":{"runs":"2","wins":"1"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"33","last_14_wins":"6","last_14_wins_pct":"18%","last_14_profit":"+3.58","ovr_runs":"113","ovr_wins":"10","ovr_wins_pct":"9%","ovr_profit":"-15.17"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"10","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-10.00","ovr_runs":"57","ovr_wins":"6","ovr_wins_pct":"11%","ovr_profit":"0.00"}}},{"age":4,"horse_id":5343989,"name":"Dancingwithmyself","dob":"2021-04-01","sex":"filly","sex_code":"F","colour":"gr","region":"IRE","breeder":"Irish National Stud","dam":"Dreamaway","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Phoenix Of Spain","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Lope De Vega","damsire":"Oasis Dream","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"Michael Bell","trainer_id":4113,"trainer_location":"Newmarket, Suffolk","trainer_14_days":{"runs":29,"wins":4,"percent":14},"owner":"David Kilburn & Christopher Wright","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Three-time winner and twice runner-up this season;
