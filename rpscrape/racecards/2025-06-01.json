The handicapper then gave us a mark of 92 which is clearly far too high, but I realise they are only doing their job. Clearly horses are penalised for running in races like that as he is now on a very harsh mark, whereas if we had gone for a handicap instead of the Craven he would have been thrown in off 81. They are keen to encourage horses to run in the better races and help nurture good-sized fields but if the price is an 11lb hike then the incentive is not there, and I think they need a re-think and should consider a more considerate approach to horses like Mr Mistoffelees. 17-05-23"}],"number":14,"draw":2,"headgear":"p","headgear_first":"1","lbs":126,"ofr":76,"rpr":98,"ts":88,"jockey":"Shane Gray","jockey_id":90103,"last_run":"21","form":"342322","trainer_rtf":"53","stats":{"course":{"runs":"1","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"12","wins":"1"},"going":{"runs":"8","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"22","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"5%","last_14_profit":"-14.00","ovr_runs":"17","ovr_wins":"1","ovr_wins_pct":"6%","ovr_profit":"-14.75"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"8","last_14_wins":"2","last_14_wins_pct":"25%","last_14_profit":"+4.63","ovr_runs":"5","ovr_wins":"3","ovr_wins_pct":"60%","ovr_profit":"+9.73"}}},{"age":5,"horse_id":4274060,"name":"Be Frank","dob":"2020-04-22","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"GB","breeder":"Jake Warren & Ben Churchill","dam":"Bonnie Arlene","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Cable Bay","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Invincible Spirit","damsire":"Excelebration","damsire_region":"IRE","trainer":"Ian Williams","trainer_id":12465,"trainer_location":"Alvechurch, Worcs","trainer_14_days":{"runs":41,"wins":7,"percent":17},"owner":"Jr Roberts Slurry Sealing Ltd","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Henry Candy","trainer_id":336,"change_date":"2024-07-26"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Ian Williams","owner_id":21077,"change_date":"2025-05-16"},{"owner":"Andrew Davis","owner_id":62677,"change_date":"2024-07-26"},{"owner":"Ninepm Limited","owner_id":330118,"change_date":"2024-04-09"},{"owner":"A J Davis","owner_id":53719,"change_date":"2023-05-22"}],"comment":"0-3 on the AW and never shone, but looked well handicapped at Newmarket recently","spotlight":"Snapped a losing run with a good bit up his sleeve at Newmarket (7f) two weeks ago and could still be leniently treated off 5lb higher; could stay a mile but what is a worry is the form he's shown in three previous runs on the AW.","quotes":null,"stable_tour":null,"number":15,"draw":9,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":125,"ofr":75,"rpr":97,"ts":64,"jockey":"Joe Fanning","jockey_id":2572,"last_run":"14","form":"4877-1","trainer_rtf":"54","stats":{"course":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"0","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"30","last_14_wins":"3","last_14_wins_pct":"10%","last_14_profit":"+1.00","ovr_runs":"81","ovr_wins":"13","ovr_wins_pct":"16%","ovr_profit":"+1.87"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"39","last_14_wins":"7","last_14_wins_pct":"18%","last_14_profit":"+30.00","ovr_runs":"128","ovr_wins":"17","ovr_wins_pct":"13%","ovr_profit":"-43.38"}}},{"age":6,"horse_id":3437913,"name":"Ernies Valentine","dob":"2019-04-04","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"gr","region":"GB","breeder":"Worksop Manor Stud","dam":"Eastern Destiny","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Havana Gold","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Teofilo","damsire":"Dubai Destination","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Ross Burdon","trainer_id":42295,"trainer_location":"Newmarket, Suffolk","trainer_14_days":{"runs":2,"wins":0,"percent":0},"owner":"The Bumblebees And Partners","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Jim Boyle","trainer_id":15108,"change_date":"2025-05-08"},{"trainer":"Simon Pearce","trainer_id":36683,"change_date":"2025-02-27"},{"trainer":"David Loughnane","trainer_id":31698,"change_date":"2024-12-16"},{"trainer":"Paul & Oliver Cole","trainer_id":37482,"change_date":"2023-11-16"}],"prev_owners":[{"owner":"Mac Racing","owner_id":122109,"change_date":"2025-05-08"},{"owner":"Ross Burdon","owner_id":352905,"change_date":"2025-02-27"},{"owner":"David Lowe","owner_id":224994,"change_date":"2024-12-16"},{"owner":"Williams, Campbell, Sennett & Cole","owner_id":303888,"change_date":"2023-11-16"},{"owner":"P F I Cole","owner_id":4206,"change_date":"2021-05-05"}],"comment":"Hopping yards during the last few months and was well beaten on his debut for this one","spotlight":"Go back far enough and a case can be made but he's been hopping yards during the last few months and was well beaten on his debut for this one.","medical":[{"date":"2023-02-03","type":"Wind Surgery"}],"quotes":null,"stable_tour":[{"horse":"Ernie's Valentine","horse_id":3437913,"quote":"He won really nicely three starts ago at Kempton and then got a bad draw back there the next time.

The handicapping system is there for a reason, he's come down and won two very nice races now. It has been discussed in the office a few times, whether we missed this and went straight to the November Handicap. Let's see how he comes out of this as he's had a couple of quick runs there. If he's bouncing, which I'm sure he will be knowing him, we might have a little look at it, if not we'll keep a mile and a half up our sleeve for next year because he loves racing and he's as good an advocate as you could have for racing, so he'll be carrying on next year as well - Jack Channon, trainer."},{"date":"2020-08-22","horse":"Certain Lad","horse_id":1996397,"race":"Sky Bet And Symphony Group Strensall Stakes (Group 3)","race_id":761936,"course":"York","course_id":107,"distance_f":9,"distance_y":1937,"quote":"Certain Lad gave me a great ride.

He had a very small setback after his Group win, which prevented us from having a crack at some of the big ones, but he'll be campaigned at the top level. There's no point running him with penalties in Group 3s this year. We're going to take a punt to see if we can land a big one. He'll go for the Prix d'Harcourt at Longchamp on Sunday, all being well, with a view to then going for the Prix Ganay. He'll have entries in the Prince of Wales's and all those other races, and if one cuts up he's that high-level horse who could pick up the pieces. He seems to be training well and he's our flagbearer, and we hope he can win some more stakes races this year.
