He progressed from his win to his third run in the July Stakes at Newmarket. I was positive about his chances there and he duly obliged, running out an impressive winner. We now have to decide which route to take. I am not one to waste my owner's money on lots of fancy entries, so you can tell how much I thought of him as I had given him an entry in the Gimcrack before he ran at Newmarket. But if he went to the Gimcrack he probably could not go for the Group 1 Prix Morny which is just over a week later, but if he goes to the Richmond at Goodwood on Thursday there would be the ideal time between races.

He was drawn nine and we were patient, but he's run a great race. We'll probably look at the Champagne Stakes now and, if he goes well there, we'll probably go to the Dewhurst. William said the softer surface just blunted his speed, although he did pick up. I'm just pleased he's stepped up to that level and I've always held him in high regard - he's a good horse for the future.

I've been delighted with him. He looks fantastic in his coat and has wintered brilliantly. He trains like a very good horse, so there should be exciting times ahead. He won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, where he beat two subsequent Group 1 winners on soft ground, but he's different class on a faster surface when he works at home. He's got huge potential and shows so much speed, so a mile will probably be as far as he wants to go. This gallop will take a bit of freshness out of him, but the day out will do him the world of good too. After that, I expect him to run in a Guineas somewhere, depending on the ground and weather. 17-04-24"},{"horse":"Iberian","horse_id":5120116,"quote":"He's a lovely colt.
