The day he gets his conditions he will put up a very different level of form to last time. As a two-year-old he won both starts, the latter a Listed race at Toulouse, but this year things have not been in his favour. His first run back was in the Sandown Classic Trial, where he lost a shoe and came back very sore for a while. I felt he ran a stormer next time out in the Dante despite the going as we had nowhere else to go. Now he is ready to go again but I am going to wait for the rain and do the right thing by the horse. I have a lot of time for him and he is possibly the best three-year-old I have ever trained, which I know sounds a big statement when you consider Wonderful Tonight, won two Group 1s last year, but I really believe he has that potential. When he gets everything in his favour he will raise a few eyebrows and we have him in at Royal Ascot as well as the Grand Prix de Paris [on July 14] and then we have to decide whether to go down the St Leger route as there are a lot of stayers in his family or shorter, when the Arc could be an option. The form of his Listed win last year has taken quite a boost as the runner-up, Cirona, subsequently won a Group 3 and was a head second in the Group 1 Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. Olivier Peslier rode him on that occasion and he regularly rings me up to inquire how the horse is doing, which pretty much says it all.

With horses it's not just about ability - you want them to be sound, have a strong constitution and have the will to want to do it. 26-02-25"}],"number":5,"draw":0,"headgear":"","headgear_first":"","lbs":164,"ofr":101,"rpr":106,"ts":50,"jockey":"Freddie Gordon(3)","jockey_id":101315,"last_run":"9","form":"3P1-13","trainer_rtf":"18","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"3","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"8","wins":"2"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"9","last_14_wins":"2","last_14_wins_pct":"22%","last_14_profit":"-1.25","ovr_runs":"10","ovr_wins":"3","ovr_wins_pct":"30%","ovr_profit":"+7.58"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"9","last_14_wins":"1","last_14_wins_pct":"11%","last_14_profit":"-5.75","ovr_runs":"23","ovr_wins":"6","ovr_wins_pct":"26%","ovr_profit":"+13.75"}}},{"age":8,"horse_id":3910266,"name":"Charlie My Boy","dob":"2017-03-04","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"gr","region":"IRE","breeder":"S Gorman","dam":"Theionlady","dam_region":"IRE","sire":"Leading Light","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"Montjeu","damsire":"Presenting","damsire_region":"GB","trainer":"J R Jenkins","trainer_id":35,"trainer_location":"Royston, Herts","trainer_14_days":{"runs":7,"wins":0,"percent":0},"owner":"Andy Taylor","prev_trainers":[{"trainer":"Keiran Burke","trainer_id":25857,"change_date":"2024-02-26"},{"trainer":"J R Jenkins","trainer_id":35,"change_date":"2023-02-23"}],"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Well handicapped on old form but looked out of sorts for this stable last year","spotlight":"Won twice on good ground (2m2f/2m4f) for Keiran Burke in 2023 but looked out of sorts for this stable this year (seven runs);
