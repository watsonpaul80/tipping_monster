I think she could be an Oaks filly. I think that was the way everyone was thinking beforehand  - William  Buick, jockey.It's been amazing. It took long enough to win a Guineas with the colts and the fillies have been hard to come by. With the fillies, it's not a page I often look at in the conditions book as we haven't had many. So, when people ask me is Desert Flower the best filly we've had, she is by far, yes. I see no reason why she can't potentially stretch up to the mile and a half. She does all her best work in the last furlong and she settles well. So, it's just a nice conversation to have. The filly herself is the one who deserves the plaudits. She's an unbeaten filly and we came here with a lot of confidence as everyone knows and she's gone and delivered. She's always looked pretty special so we were confident. At one point, if you were watching it, you'd think we had a battle on our hands but I just knew that as soon as she hits that rising ground she will find another gear. It's what she does at home - she trains on a hill every day, so hills don't worry her. I wasn't surprised or too worried watching the race. We saw it in the Fillies' Mile and in the May Hill, she just goes through those gears and at one point she just looks a little bit sticky and with 'the Dip' here, as we know, especially with this quicker ground today. I said to Will [Buick] if you can get her into her rhythm because if you're sat there comfortably at the top of the 'the Dip' and then all of a sudden you're putting them on their head to go into 'the Dip' that's when they just start to stumble a little bit or to find their feet. We'll make a plan now, whether it's Ascot or whether we decide whether she's capable of stepping up a bit further - Charlie Appleby, trainer."},{"date":"2024-10-11","horse":"Desert Flower","horse_id":6161666,"race":"bet365 Fillies' Mile (Group 1)","race_id":873077,"course":"Newmarket","course_id":38,"distance_f":8,"distance_y":1760,"quote":"I see no reason not to do that [go straight to 1,000 Guineas], as Desert Flower won't take much to get fit.

The drop back to 7f did the trick as next time out he won at Wolverhampton. He has run well in defeat since, notably when a neck second at Kempton. His last three runs, all on turf, have not been great but he is a solid horse and I am hoping that he can put those efforts behind him back at Newbury on Tuesday. I am looking for a nice run from him this week, but it could be that we have him wrong and he is a sprinter. 29-06-23"}],"number":12,"draw":12,"headgear":"b","headgear_first":"","lbs":116,"ofr":65,"rpr":93,"ts":71,"jockey":"Isobelle Chalmers(7)","jockey_id":103730,"last_run":"10","form":"425656","trainer_rtf":"38","stats":{"course":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"distance":{"runs":"11","wins":"0"},"going":{"runs":"2","wins":"0"},"jockey":{"last_14_runs":"3","last_14_wins":"0","last_14_wins_pct":"0%","last_14_profit":"-3.00","ovr_runs":"0","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"-","ovr_profit":"0.00"},"trainer":{"last_14_runs":"16","last_14_wins":"2","last_14_wins_pct":"13%","last_14_profit":"-4.00","ovr_runs":"19","ovr_wins":"0","ovr_wins_pct":"0%","ovr_profit":"-19.00"}}}]},"5:25":{"course":"Goodwood","course_id":21,"race_id":895021,"date":"2025-06-06","off_time":"5:25","race_name":"Bet Clever BetGoodwin Apprentice Handicap","distance_round":"1m1f","distance":"1m1f11y","distance_f":9.0,"region":"GB","pattern":"","race_class":"Class 5","type":"Flat","age_band":"4yo+","rating_band":"0-70","prize":"£5,574","field_size":11,"going_detailed":"GOOD (GoingStick: 7.1) (Rail Movements: 5.25, 5.59, 7.09 & 7.44 +10yds and 8.18 +5yds)","rail_movements":"","stalls":"1m1f - Inside; 1m4f - Outside; Remainder - Centre","weather":"Light rain","going":"Good","surface":"Turf","runners":[{"age":7,"horse_id":3136504,"name":"Uncle Dick","dob":"2018-04-23","sex":"gelding","sex_code":"G","colour":"b","region":"GB","breeder":"R E Crutchley","dam":"Golden Waters","dam_region":"GB","sire":"Toronado","sire_region":"IRE","grandsire":"High Chaparral","damsire":"Dubai Destination","damsire_region":"USA","trainer":"Eve Johnson Houghton","trainer_id":18920,"trainer_location":"Blewbury, Oxfordshire","trainer_14_days":{"runs":33,"wins":3,"percent":9},"owner":"Eden Racing Club","prev_trainers":null,"prev_owners":null,"comment":"Best at Brighton where he ran quite well last time; has respectable form here","spotlight":"Has never won away from Brighton on turf (seven wins there) but signs of rediscovering some form back there ten days ago; only beaten about 2l in two of his three runs here; goes on all ground.","quotes":[{"date":"2024-08-07","horse":"Uncle Dick","horse_id":3136504,"race":"Carlsberg Danish Pilsner Brighton Mile Challenge Handicap (For the Brighton Mile Challenge Trophy)","race_id":872149,"course":"Brighton","course_id":7,"distance_f":8,"distance_y":1756,"quote":"Uncle Dick is an absolute legend.

He was running well without doing an awful lot, but when he got down to a mark of 50 he started winning. We put a visor on and it helped a bit, but it wasn't until he got the blinkers on that things started to happen. Even the first day he won at Nottingham, I still maintain that if he hadn't got a bump near the finish, he'd have finished second; he got a bump and seemed to take off and won really well. He then went to Beverley and had a bit of a troubled passage but got to the front and was well on top at the finish. When he went to Wetherby for his third success, the ground was plenty quick enough for him and the race didn't go as smoothly as we'd have liked, but he still won, whiwas fair play to him. He's got his confidence back and remembered how to win. If he wants to win again, he's still a long way ahead of the handicapper.
