He got wiped out at the start, which caused him to lose his action, and from there on things never went right. Unfortunately he came back sore, having knocked a joint. It has been hard work getting him back but he's there now and ready to go again. I looked at Royal Ascot but he had a slightly dirty scope before and you must be 100 per cent for that meeting. He heads to Newmarket for the July meeting, where we'll aim for the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes over a mile and then we'll look to the Thoroughbred Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. He'll run at Newmarket as long as they get nice ground and hopefully we can get him back to where he was before the Guineas.
