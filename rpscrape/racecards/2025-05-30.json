He was a bit laid-back so he took time to learn and adjust as the race progressed, but he's got a lovely big stride and is a horse who has a future. I'll have to talk to the Middleham Park team about plans and we might just feel our way gradually and have a bigger target towards the end of the year or we could pitch him in somewhere nicer next time, but we'll see how he is. He's an exciting horse, but he's still got a bit to learn and is a bit raw. He'd shown enough at home, plenty to be honest, but he's so laid-back, which was a little concern of mine and that's maybe why he was a longer price than he should have been. I think he's more 6f than 5f and he may get further next year; his stride is quite eyecatching and he seems to do everything effortlessly as you could see with Danny, who didn't have to give him any urgings.

He wasn't very quickly away and was mid-division but easily made his way through the field and went fourth with a furlong left to run, then once Shane asked him he ran on strongly to take the race. I was delighted with that effort as he justified the faith I've always had in him. This big, raw horse has really thrived physically since then.
