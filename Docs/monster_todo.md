## ⚙️ Robustness & Error Handling

While you have excellent logging, enhancing error handling and alerting for critical failures will significantly improve system stability and your peace of mind.

* **Automated Alerts for Key Failures:**
    * **[ ]** Implement instant alerts (e.g., via a dedicated Telegram bot message or email) if critical cron jobs or essential scripts (e.g., `dispatch_tips.py`, `track_daily_performance_dual_corrected.py`) fail to execute successfully. This ensures you're immediately aware of any issues that could impact tip delivery or ROI tracking.
* **Data Validation at Ingestion:**
    * **[ ]** Add checks for data integrity at crucial stages of data ingestion (e.g., after scraping racecards, before ML inference). This includes verifying file formats, checking for empty files, and ensuring expected data fields are present. Early detection of malformed or missing data can prevent downstream processing errors and model inaccuracies.

    [x] [HIGH] Wrap all cron jobs in safecron.sh with Telegram alerts

🧠 Auto-Tweet Fallback Support
- Description: Improve `auto_tweet_tips.py` by adding fallback logic to use `logs/sent_tips_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` when `predictions/YYYY-MM-DD/tips_with_odds.jsonl` is missing.
- Purpose: Ensures tips are still posted to Twitter even if the standard tips file isn’t created (e.g. Telegram confidence filtering still passed tips).
- Notes:
  - Only fallback if `tips_with_odds.jsonl` is missing.
  - Log fallback usage to console or log file.
  - Still skip post if fallback file is also missing.
- Status: 🧠 Backlog

 ## 🔙 Backlog

### 🎯 Odds Tracking Improvements
**Goal:** Accurately reflect the best available odds at time of tip to improve ROI accuracy and transparency.

- [ ] Update `dispatch_tips.py` to record best available odds at time of tip
  - Field name: `"best_odds"`
  - Source: Betfair API snapshot (or future OddsChecker/bookie scrape)
  - Store in `logs/sent_tips_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
  - Preserve `"bf_sp"` for later analysis but avoid using in ROI calc

- [ ] Update ROI tracker (`roi_tracker_advised.py`)
  - Use `"best_odds"` if available instead of `"bf_sp"` or `"odds"`
  - Add fallback logic:
    ```python
    odds = row.get("best_odds", row.get("bf_sp", row.get("odds", 0.0)))
    ```

- [ ] Highlight steamers retrospectively:
  - Example: "💸 Advised at 14/1, SP 4.3" in Telegram or summary logs

- [ ] (Optional) Log all three: advised price, BF SP, settled price for transparency

- [ ] (Optional) Add price movement stats to weekly summaries

**Impact:** Will significantly improve reported ROI, help detect steamers, and enhance trust if monetised later.

## 🧠 Missing Tasks To Add (Backlog / Upcoming)

### 🔥 High Priority
- [ ] Implement best odds tracking (record SP or bookmaker top price instead of just Betfair SP)
- [ ] Add fallback logic for missing `logs/sent_tips_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (e.g. rebuild from `tips_summary.txt` or prediction output)
- [ ] Telegram alert if `dispatch_tips.py` completes but sends 0 tips (use dispatch log check)
- [ ] Add alert if odds fetch fails or returns fewer than expected races

### 🧠 Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhance Sniper Mode with:
  - [ ] % price movement from 08:00 odds
  - [ ] Volume/market overlays (if accessible from Betfair)
  - [ ] Steamer scoring & ranking system

    ```
    🏇 Victor Cee (2.8) ✅  
    🏇 Selmiya (7.6) ❌  
    ```
- [ ] Add separate daily summary for NAP performance

### 📈 Danger Fav Detection
