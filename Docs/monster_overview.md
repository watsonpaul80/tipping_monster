## ⚙️ SCRIPT EXPLANATIONS

* `core/train_model_v6.py`: Trains an XGBoost classifier using features like rating, class, form, trainer, jockey, etc.
* `train_place_model.py`: Predicts whether a runner finishes in the top 3 using the same feature set.
* `python -m core.run_inference_and_select_top1`: Uses the model to predict a winner per race with confidence scores. Run it from the repo root (or add the repo root to `PYTHONPATH`) so it can locate the `core` package.
* `core/merge_odds_into_tips.py`: Adds price info to each runner in the tip file.
* `core/dispatch_tips.py`: Outputs NAPs, best bets, and high confidence runners into a formatted Telegram message.
* `core/dispatch_all_tips.py`: Sends every generated tip for a day. Use `--telegram` to post to Telegram and `--batch-size` to control how many tips per message (ensure `TG_USER_ID` is set).
* `roi/roi_tracker_advised.py`: Matches tips with results and calculates each-way profit. Also acts as the main daily tracker – filters, calculates profit, generates tip results CSV. Uses the `requests` library to send ROI summaries to Telegram.
* `roi/calibrate_confidence_daily.py`: Logs ROI by confidence bin (e.g. 0.80–0.90, 0.90–1.00).
* `roi/weekly_roi_summary.py`: Aggregates weekly tips and profits. Rolls up recent tips into ISO week summaries for weekly ROI.
* `roi/generate_weekly_summary.py`: Outputs weekly performance in human-readable format.
* `roi/generate_weekly_roi.py`: Creates `weekly_summary_YYYY-WW.csv` with ROI and strike rate for the week.
* `roi/generate_tip_results_csv_with_mode_FINAL.py`: (Called by ROI tracker) Calculates wins, places, profit, ROI per tip.
* `roi/send_daily_roi_summary.py`: Posts a daily summary to Telegram with ROI and profit.

## 📈 PERFORMANCE TRACKING & ROI – HOW IT WORKS

Tipping Monster tracks daily and weekly performance using a **point-based ROI system**.

### 💡 Overview

* Every day, tip outcomes are compared with **Betfair SP odds**. (Note: Also uses best realistic odds from snapshots)
* ROI is calculated in both:
    * **Level mode** (1pt win/each-way per tip)
    * **Advised mode** (confidence-weighted staking from the model)
* The system tracks: Tips count, Winners, Places (for each-way logic), Profit in points, ROI %
* Only tips with odds ≥ 5.0 are eligible for **each-way profit** to avoid false positives on short-odds places.
* Supports each-way place terms.
* Confidence bands logged for ROI per bin.
* Weekly summaries in ISO format.
* `monster_confidence_per_day_with_roi.csv` logs band stats.

### Stakes and Place Terms from ROI Tracking Logic
* Stakes:
    * Singles: 1pt Win (or 0.5pt EW for longshots)
* Place terms:
    * <5 runners: Win Only
    * 5–7: 2 places @ 1/4 odds
    * 8+: 3 places @ 1/5 odds (or 3 places @ 1/4 for 12–15 runner handicaps, 4 @ 1/4 for 16+)

## 🔎 MODEL TRANSPARENCY & SELF‑TRAINING

Tipping Monster computes **SHAP** values for every prediction to highlight the
top features pushing a horse toward or away from being tipped. Global feature
importance is recorded during training, while per‑tip explanations feed into the
weekly ROI reports so subscribers see *why* each runner was selected.

Past tips are merged back into the dataset (`was_tipped`, `tip_profit`,
`confidence_band`) allowing the model to retrain on its own results. This
feedback loop continually refines accuracy and keeps the weekly insights fresh.

---

## 🚧 PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS

* Logic-based commentary blocks (e.g., "📉 Class Drop, 📈 In Form, Conf: 92%")
* Parallel model comparison (v6 vs v7)
* Drawdown tracking in ROI logs
