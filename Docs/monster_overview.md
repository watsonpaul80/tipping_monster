- `merge_odds_into_tips.py`: Adds price info to each runner in the tip file.
- `dispatch_tips.py`: Outputs NAPs, best bets, and high confidence runners into a formatted Telegram message.
- `roi_tracker_advised_FIXED_v3.py`: Matches tips with results and calculates each-way profit.
- `calibrate_confidence_daily.py`: Logs ROI by confidence bin (e.g. 0.80‚Äì0.90, 0.90‚Äì1.00).
- `weekly_roi_summary.py`: Aggregates weekly tips and profits.
- `generate_weekly_summary.py`: Outputs weekly performance in human-readable format.

## üì£ Auto-Tweeting Tips to Twitter (monstertweeter module)

The `monstertweeter/auto_tweet_tips.py` script publishes all **daily Tipping Monster selections** to Twitter (X) as a thread. It runs automatically each morning (08:15 via cron) **after tips have been dispatched** to Telegram.

This system increases transparency and reach by making the Monster's free tips publicly visible on social media ‚Äî without revealing paid content such as Sniper alerts.

### ‚úÖ What It Does
- Posts a Twitter thread of all selections from `tips_with_odds.jsonl`
- Highlights the **NAP** (highest-confidence selection)
- Includes **yesterday‚Äôs ROI** from `logs/tips_results_YYYY-MM-DD_advised.csv`
- Excludes Sniper-only tips and anything under the public tipping threshold (e.g. confidence < 0.80)
- Branded with hashtags like `#TippingMonster` for growth and visibility

---

## üß† Auto-Tweet Fallback Logic (Planned)

### Problem
If **no tips meet the 0.80 confidence threshold**, the dispatch script doesn‚Äôt create `tips_with_odds.jsonl`, and no tweet is sent ‚Äî even though tips may have been delivered or manually posted.

### ‚úÖ What We Have Now
- Clean daily Twitter posts when tips exist
- ROI included from previous day
- Silent skip if `tips_with_odds.jsonl` is missing
- Logging and threading work reliably

### ‚ùå What‚Äôs Missing
- No fallback when tips are filtered out
- `logs/sent_tips_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` is not used by the Twitter module
- Creates gaps in public posting when the Telegram side was still active

### üîß What We Need to Solve
- Update `auto_tweet_tips.py` to fallback to `logs/sent_tips_*.jsonl` if `tips_with_odds.jsonl` is absent
- Tweet a message like: ‚Äúüì≠ No tips today ‚Äî Monster‚Äôs confidence was below threshold‚Äù if both are empty
- Ensure clear logging of fallback usage for transparency
- Preserve the discipline of the Monster while maintaining a daily public presence

---

### üöÄ Steam Sniper Mode (Fully Implemented)

An innovative feature designed to detect significant market movements and dispatch lucrative alerts for horses **not already tipped** by the main model.

* **üéØ Smart Mover Detection:** Identifies big Betfair price movers.
* **‚è±Ô∏è Scheduled Monitoring:** Automated cron jobs at `12:00` or `13:00` for continuous market surveillance, managed by automated schedule + `at` jobs.
* **‚ö°Ô∏è Instant Alerts:** Sends tagged alerts (e.g., *"ü•∑ Steam Sniper: Al Ameen ‚Äì 12/1 ‚Üí 4/1"*) directly to Telegram.
* **üìä Odds Snapshots:** `Workspace_betfair_odds.py` supports `--label` for capturing specific odds snapshots.
* **‚öñÔ∏è Odds Comparison:** `compare_odds_to_0800.py` is built and ready for comparing current odds to the 08:00 baseline.
* **üì§ Sniper Dispatch:** `dispatch_snipers.py` is built and triggers Telegram alerts.
* **üîÑ Job Management:** `load_sniper_jobs.sh` loads each snapshot into the `at` queue for scheduled execution.
* **üìà Performance Tracking:** `evaluate_steamers.py` logs results and calculates ROI for sniper picks.
* **üóìÔ∏è Weekly Summaries:** `steam_sniper_weekly_summary.py` provides a comprehensive weekly sniper ROI summary to Telegram.

## üìà ROI Tracking ‚Äì How It Works

Tipping Monster tracks daily and weekly performance using a **point-based ROI system**.

### üí° Overview

- Every day, tip outcomes are compared with **Betfair SP odds**.
- ROI is calculated in both:
  - **Level mode** (1pt win/each-way per tip)
  - **Advised mode** (confidence-weighted staking from the model)
- The system tracks:
  - Tips count
  - Winners
  - Places (for each-way logic)
  - Profit in points
  - ROI %

Only tips with odds ‚â• 5.0 are eligible for **each-way profit** to avoid false positives on short-odds places.

## üß† Steam Sniper ‚Äî Core Logic

The Steam Sniper module is engineered to detect significant market movers that were **not already tipped** by the main model. It operates autonomously throughout the day, delivering sharp, "sniper-style" alerts to Telegram upon detection of strong price movements.

* **Baseline Creation:** At `08:00`, a crucial snapshot of Betfair odds is saved as `odds_snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD_0800.json`.
* **Live Snapshots:** As the day progresses, the system captures additional odds snapshots at strategic race-relative times (e.g., T‚Äì60, T‚Äì30, T‚Äì10 minutes before race start).
* **Dynamic Comparison:** Each new snapshot is rigorously compared against the 08:00 baseline using `compare_odds_to_0800.py`.
* **Intelligent Filtering:** Horses already tipped by the main model are automatically filtered out to avoid redundancy.
* **Trigger Mechanism:** If a horse's odds demonstrate a significant drop (e.g., from 10/1 to 5/1), it is immediately flagged as a **steamer**.
* **Instant Delivery:** Flagged steamers are swiftly dispatched via `dispatch_snipers.py` to Telegram, accompanied by a distinctive ‚ö°Ô∏è alert message.

---

## üßæ Summary Reports

The Steam Sniper module generates detailed reports to keep you informed of its performance.

* **Daily Summary:** `generate_daily_steamer_summary.py` compiles a plain-text report, saved to:
    ```
    logs/steam_sniper_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
    ```
    This report includes:
    * Number of steamers flagged.
    * Number of winners.
    * Flat-stake ROI for sniper picks.

* **Weekly Summary:** `steam_sniper_weekly_summary.py` aggregates all daily summaries to produce a comprehensive 7-day recap, which is then sent directly to Telegram.

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Manual Commands (For Debugging/Specific Checks)

While the entire sniper stack is fully automated, these commands can be invaluable for manual checks or debugging:

```bash
# List today's sniper files:
ls steamers_$(date +%F)_*.json

# Check the number of steamers in a specific file (e.g., for 14:00 snapshot):
cat steamers_$(date +%F)_1400.json | jq length

# Manually fetch an odds snapshot (e.g., labeled 1400):
python fetch_betfair_odds.py --label 1400

# Manually detect steamers by comparing a specific snapshot to the 08:00 baseline:
python compare_odds_to_0800.py --snapshot odds_snapshots/<span class="math-inline">\(date \+%F\)\_1400\.json
\# Manually send steamer alerts from a specific source file\:
python dispatch\_snipers\.py \-\-source steamers\_</span>(date +%F)_1400.json

# Manually re-run ROI evaluation for a specific snapshot and date with debug info:
python evaluate_steamers.py --label 1400 --date $(date +%F) --debug
